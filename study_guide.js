/*
- Difference between static and instance methods (when to use and what they are called on)
        -static methods : a method that belongs to and invoked in the class ,also called class methods
        - instance methods : a method that belongs to instances of a class,not the class itself

- Types of Errors you may see in JavaScript code and what would cause them to be thrown
        -   **TypeError:**
                    -   Operation that is attached the operand is of the wrong
                    type.

                     -   Re-assign a const variable;

                     -   When trying to invoke a method that doesn't exist an object

        -   **ReferenceError:**
                     -   Calling variables or methods that have not been declared or are misspelled _(attempting to reference something that has not been defined)._

                     -   i.e typo in variable name or invoking a function that has not been declared.

        -   **SyntaxError:**
                      -   Occur during parsing time (when code is broken into meaningful chunks (tokens). First thing that happens when code is run, occurs before compilation time).

                     -   i.e.: misspell a keyword, or have an extra/missing token. (think '}')

- How to make a child class and how it differs in syntax from its parent

- Explain polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance and how they contribute to OOP

- Explain both DRY coding and coding that meets the principle of SRP

- Be able to explain what makes arrow functions special and where they may cause problems

- Explain context and identify the keyword that represents an object's context

- Be able to identify key ideas of OOP

- Be able to look at a block of test code and describe the best description of the function it tests

- Explain the benefits of TDD

- Be able to identify when bind, call or apply may correct an error in code



//------------------- for coding problems --------------------------------

- Reading specs and writing code based on the test code

- Writing parent and child classes, including their constructors and setting up instance variables, both ones that are immediately/default set upon instantiation and those created by passing in variables in the constructor.

- Importing and exporting modules using module.exports (HINT!!: pay attention to how files are pulled into the spec file to tell you how to export them)

- Writing instance methods that access properties of instances of a class within another class

- Using instanceOf to see if something is a child of a parent class

- Throwing errors if a condition is not met
